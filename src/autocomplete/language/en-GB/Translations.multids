Configs/DebounceDuration/Description: Pressing a key to search once will lead to lagging, here set the search anti-shake duration, meaning two consecutive key presses within this duration will be judged as inputting, and will wait for you to finish typing before searching, in milliseconds.
Configs/SearchSystemTitle/Caption: Freely Search System Tiddler Title
Configs/SearchSystemTitle/Description: There are a large number of system titles in the wiki that make up the Tiddlywiki operating system, and searching for them can be slow. Check this option if you are one of Tiddlywiki's developers and often search for system titles. (only involves free searching of system tiddlers, so you can search layouts, system actions, etc. without checking this option)
Configs/CacheSystemTiddlers/Caption: Caching system tiddlers
Configs/CacheSystemTiddlers/Description: Assumed system tiddlers don't change during wiki usage, so they are only loaded to the front-end cache once for the initial search, and then no longer loaded with the latest data for subsequent searches. Note that this option includes all results from searches done with {{$:/plugins/linonetwo/autocomplete/commands/help/System!!command-palette-prefix}}. If you are part of the developers of Tiddlywiki and the system tiddlers change frequently, then you can uncheck this option. (only about search layout, system actions, etc., not about free search system tiddlers)

Configs/MissingFilterOnTop/Caption: Missing Filter On Top
Configs/MissingFilterOnTop/Description: When checked, when using `[` filter search mode, if there is no matching filter, it will be displayed on top, so that you can directly use the new filter you just entered to search.
